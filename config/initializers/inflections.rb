# Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
# are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
# locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:

ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
  #   inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, "\\1en"
  #   inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, "\\1"
  #   inflect.irregular "person", "people"
  #   inflect.uncountable %w( fish sheep )

  inflect.irregular "part received", "parts received"
  inflect.irregular "part_received", "parts_received"
  inflect.irregular "foot", "feet"
  inflect.irregular "ft", "ft"
end

# These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
# ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
#   inflect.acronym "RESTful"
# end
